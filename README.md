## My process

I started by building the HTML, then i styled it and lastly i built teh JavaScript components.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project i have refined a little my CSS skill, in particular the usage of flexbox and selector targeting with a specific hierarchy. This was also my first project using JS as i am currently studying it, so it was good practice overall.

### Continued development

I want to continue focus on teh development of my JS skills and also get better at produce clear and cry CSS and HTMl code.
